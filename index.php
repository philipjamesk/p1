          <h4>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do</h4>
          <p>I have been working as a TV director in the Boston market for 20 years. Having seen technology change both how shows are made and how they are delivered to the customers in that time, I am back in school because I want to be on the front lines of the new technologies and not left beind.</p>

          <h4>Why are you taking this course?</h4>
          <p>I have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but would like to understand more about the server side of web development. I had to learn a tiny bit of PHP for a Wordpress site in <a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-web-content-management-systems-site-development/24048">DGMD E-25</a>, and would like to learn a lot more.</p>

          <h4>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h4>
          <p>I programmed on my Commodore 64 as a child, but never was too serious with it. I had a concentration in CS as an undergrad (20 years ago), but my career took me away from the programming side of computers. I have taken <a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-computer-science-using-java-i/14289">CSCI E-10A</a> and <a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-computer-science-using-java-ii/24027">CSCI E-10B</a> at Harvard Extension School as part of Digital Media Arts Master's Program. </p>

          <h4>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h4>
          <p>I am working on a MacBook Pro which is coming up on four years old and recently survived an entire cup of coffee being spilled on it (well everything but the optical drive survived). I am running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, and do most of my browsing and testing in Chrome.</p>

          <h4>Anything else we should know?</h4>
          <p>Hmm... After not leaving North America for the first 36 years of my life, I made it to all seven continents between June 2011 and January 2015. I take a teddy bear made by my grandmother in 1967 on all of my trips since it was her dream to travel the world.</p>
